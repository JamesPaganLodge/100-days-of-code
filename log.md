# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 31, 2018 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Installing Flutter and tidying up the CaveSurv repo.

**Thoughts:** I didnt think it would take that long to download and extract the archive, hopefully I can get on with some actual coding next time. This is the part that I always find hard about starting is the setup, I do have VScode set up now though.
